Version 1.8.3.2
===============

# Changes

- Prevent time progression from going too far in gameplay <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This is a mitigation towards a bug in the game's audio engine, which has been confirmed by the maintainer.
  - See [this](https://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=20482.0) (technical) thread for more information.
- Revert to semi-frame based input time <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This partially reverts the input time adjustment made in version 1.8.3, which was prone to the aforementioned bug. 

# Fixes

- Fix HUD data potentially being saved to the previously selected skin's `skin.json` <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span> 
- Fix beatmap download hard-locking if beatmapset extraction fails <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix illegal characters in filenames persisting when extracting beatmapset <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>

Version 1.8.3.1
===============

# Additions

- Added support for osu!lazer's perfect curve sliders with more than 3 control points <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Such sliders will be parsed as BÃ©zier sliders.

# Changes

- Always show HUD back button regardless of hide gameplay UI setting <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Display leaderboard, unstable rate counter, average offset counter, and hit error meter in default HUD <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>

# Bug Fixes

- Fix Traceable mod being displayed as SU instead of TC <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix hide gameplay UI setting not working <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix "show scoreboard" setting in mod menu not working <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix presses in Autopilot mod not being counted towards taps per second counter <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix inherited blending not using the blending function of an entity's parent <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I)</span>
- Fix gameplay music potentially starting one frame late <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix gameplay progression potentially going backwards when music has not started <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix team VS score potentially being saved and uploaded as solo score in multiplayer <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix slider path anchor coordinates being parsed into integer instead of decimal for osu!lazer exported beatmaps <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - osu!lazer exports these coordinates to decimals, so the current decoding logic will invalidate such sliders.
  - I'm not sure if the coordinates are supposed to be exported in decimals, since osu!stable appears to decode such
    beatmaps successfully but truncates the coordinates after import.
- Fix hitobject position coordinates being parsed into integer instead of decimal for osu!lazer exported beatmaps <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - osu!lazer supports decimal coordinates, but truncates them when exporting for compatibility with osu!stable (`.osz`).
    However, during import, it does not truncate the coordinates in v128 beatmaps or later. This change adds support for
    such beatmaps.

# Removals

- Remove memory usage counter in gameplay <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This only affects test clients.

Version 1.8.3
=============

# Additions

- Add snaking out sliders setting <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Add gameplay HUD editor <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I) and [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span> 
  - For the time being, the editor only allows you to resize and rescale elements. More elements and operations will be
    added in the future (divide and conquer, as they say).
  - The HUD settings are saved in `skin.json` under the `HUD` property.
- Add hit judgement result specific colors to hit error meter indicators <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Add vibration feedback on hitobject hit <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Acivev](https://github.com/Acivev)</span>
  - This can be managed under the `Input` category in options
- Add Traceable (TC) mod <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Only shows approach circles, slider body borders, slider ticks, and slider repeat arrows
  - Incompatible with the Hidden (HD) mod
  - Current score multiplier is 1.06
  - Impacts star rating (and therefore performance points) for osu!droid star rating system and performance points for
    osu!standard star rating system
  - Mod icon can be skinned with `selection-mod-traceable`

# Changes

- Offset input time with audio time instead of frame time <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This only applies when you have the `Fix frame offset` setting enabled. Theoretically, this setting should be
    removed (and enabled by default) to enforce the proper offset in input time. However, due to numerous feedbacks,
    this option has been kept.
- Optimize cursor animation performance during gameplay <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I)</span>
- Hide beatmap count of default beatmap collection <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Cycle between score online beatmap leaderboard - pp online beatmap leaderboard - local beatmap leaderboard in
  leaderboard switcher button <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Replace the Precise (PR) default mod icon <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Acivev](https://github.com/Acivev)</span>
- Optimize difficulty calculation by only calculating necessary skills <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Improve hit error meter readability <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I)</span>
  - The hit error area is now slightly transparent to give a better visibility for hit error indicators.
- Stretch game surface to fullscreen <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I)</span>
  - This is an attempt to fix an (abnormally) large blank area in some devices. This area restriction is provided by
    Android and is called the **cutout area**.
  - This means that the game will **also render in the display's cutout area (i.e., front camera notches)**. This is
    intended for now and is aimed to be improved in later versions.
- Bump difficulty calculator version <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Triggers difficulty calculation across all beatmaps to apply the most recent update and bug fixes towards the
    algorithm.

- Fix slider head, tick, repeat, and tail fade in durations being affected by force AR <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>

# Removals

- Remove offset minimalization between beatmap time and audio time <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - When beatmap time was offset from audio time by a certain duration, the game would attempt to match with audio time
    by slowing down or speeding up gameplay. This happened due to differences in frame time and audio time progression.
  - This has been removed and beatmap time is now equal to audio time.
- Remove `Low-latency synchronization` setting <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This setting influenced the operation above by reducing the maximum allowable offset when enabled. Since the
    operation has been removed, this setting is now irrelevant.
- Remove the following settings as they have been merged with the HUD editor: <span style="font-size: 0.75em">(by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I))</span>
  - Progress indicator type
  - Hit error meter
  - Show average offset
  - Show unstable rate
  - Display real-time PP counter
- Remove `Hide navigation bar` setting <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I)</span>
  - This is now enabled by default. 
- Remove `Global beatmap leaderboard scoring mode` setting <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This has been moved to the leaderboard switcher button.
